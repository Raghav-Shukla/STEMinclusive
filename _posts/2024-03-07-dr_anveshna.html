<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/anveshna-srivastava/home" target="_blank">Dr. Anveshna Srivastava</a> is a
    Visiting Professor in the department
    of Cognitive Sciences at IIT Kanpur.
</p>
<p>Dr. Anveshna Srivastava was raised in Ballia, a small town that marks the easternmost border of Uttar Pradesh with
    Bihar. The land of Shaheed Mangal Pandey, Ballia is the cradle of India’s first uprising against the Britishers,
    which
    made it earn the title of ‘Baagi’ (a rebel). Dr. Anveshna is a proud daughter of ‘Baagi’ Ballia and carries the
    ‘baagi’
    germ within her to fight off inequalities in education.</p>
<p>A daughter of a teacher and a lawyer, Dr. Anveshna had a simple middle-class upbringing. Her academic journey began
    at
    the only English medium school in the town, Holy Cross, in the late 1980s. While growing up, she was deeply inspired
    by
    her mother, Late Neeru Krishna Srivastava, who taught History & Civics in the same school. Her mother’s honesty,
    integrity, and empathy shaped her understanding of worldly interactions and the role of humans in society. In one
    incident, when the mother-daughter duo were discussing the sources of human pain and agony, the mother advocated
    that
    books were human’s best friend and one may find solace in them when things were not going right. This was the moment
    of
    deep revelation for a 11-year-old Anveshna and laid the foundation for her love and respect for learning.
</p>
<p>With reverence for knowledge and curiosity to learn new concepts, Anveshna started to observe the underlying
    connections
    across different subjects. Despite limited finances, her parents did all to make sure she had the required resources.
    However, she was soon exposed to the deep patriarchal mindset of our society and was quick to realize that the field
    was
    uneven for women. For instance, even within her extended family, her brown skin was a matter of deep concern.
    Concerned
    relatives offered unsolicited suggestions which ranged from the natural haldi-besan (turmeric-chickpea flour) scrub
    to
    the chemically laden and outrightly stupid ‘Fair & Lovely’ cream. However, the ‘books are best friends’ mantra
    helped
    her through several such negative and judgmental situations. Soon after, she found herself pursuing a Bachelor's
    degree
    in Botany (Honours) from Miranda House at Delhi University. The journey from Ballia to Delhi was much more than just
    a
    1000 km path. It was a journey of thoughts and aspirations! And it had its share of troubles, hard work, and of
    course,
    learning.
</p>
<p>Her daily 3 hours of travel from her uncle’s home to college & back involved changing multiple buses, and the commute
    was nothing short of traumatic. There was no guarantee that one would not be touched inappropriately. One could just
    never afford to be in a ‘non-alert’ mode. This was the time when the first Delhi Metro was launched from Kashmere
    Gate
    to Vishwavidyalaya. By her final year, she used to travel carrying her dissection needles in hand, just in case!
    This
    level of safety for the women in the heart of our capital city was disturbing for her.
</p>
<p>She then pursued her Master's degree in Biochemistry from Dehradun and Ph.D. in Science Education from Mumbai. As a
    young researcher, her ideas were deeply influenced by Gandhi’s Hind Swaraj and Nai Taleem. She realized that the
    education system was stubbornly insular to the idea of ‘learning’. It was too focused on learning ‘outcomes’, rather
    than on the ‘processes’. For Anveshna, the mushrooming of coaching classes for competitive exams all over the
    country at
    the expense of learning in the schools was a testament to society’s obsession with outcomes, where education was
    nothing
    more than a form of lucrative business or a gateway to economic security. She wanted to separate education from
    learning. Her work started during her PhD at the Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education, TIFR, where she started
    designing low-cost, pedagogical tools to assist the learning ‘processes’ of students, focusing on STEM concepts.
    These
    tools included designing a simple gesture to help students understand the structure of the DNA molecule, the
    pedagogical
    method of 3-D ‘model-dissection’ to help teachers save time while getting the benefits of engaging with a physical
    model, the method of concept-mapping analysis for identifying the learning stages of learners, etc.
</p>
<p>During her postdoctoral jobs at IIT Kanpur & IIT Bombay, she focused on students’ thinking and reasoning processes.
    This
    stemmed from her ideological stance that it was important to target learners’ ability to think and reason, rather
    than
    help them perform better on some measure of learning outcome. Changing mindset and temperament is far more difficult
    to
    achieve than scoring good marks. Hence, her work focused on ‘counterfactual reasoning’, ‘critical thinking’, etc. to
    help learners develop scientific temperament. At IIT Bombay, she studied cutting-edge technological interfaces to
    assess
    their efficacy in learning processes. For instance, in a recent work, she studied an Augmented Reality tool to
    understand its impact on learners’ spatial ability, a cognitive ability known to have a positive impact on
    achievement
    in STEM fields.
</p>
<p>Her relentless efforts in making scientific concepts fun and easy to learn is based on her strong interdisciplinary
    leanings where she thinks that it is time we liberate our kids from the shackles of boundaries between different
    subjects and let them enjoy learning by organically linking different concepts. Working in this direction, she has
    published <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/anveshna-srivastava/letters-in-action" target="_blank">‘Letters in Action’</a>, a basic English alphabet book for pre-primary kids to make them learn concepts by
    linking
    the functional relationships between different objects of the world. She is currently working on the Hindi
    counterpart
    of this book, called ‘Aksharon ki Udaan’.
</p>
<p>She has recently joined as a Visiting Faculty in the Department of Cognitive Science at IIT Kanpur. In line with her
    commitment to influencing thinking and reasoning abilities, she is now working on developing computational thinking
    in
    middle school students. She is experimenting with innovative methods so that they can be used even in
    resource-strapped
    conditions, where access to computers and the internet is still a distant dream.</p>
<p>Dr. Anveshna's commitment extends beyond the classroom and lab. At IIT Kanpur, she spearheads a social initiative
    aimed
    at equipping children from low socioeconomic backgrounds with basic educational opportunities. She conducts weekly
    classes for these children with the help of a couple of committed volunteers. This program identifies motivated
    children
    and makes them appear for the entrance exam of IITK’s ‘Opportunity School’. On clearing the entrance on their merit,
    these children are funded by the program to commence their schooling. In the past one and a half years, three
    children
    have been brought to mainstream education via this program and Dr. Anveshna gives credit to the children for
    believing
    in their abilities to alter the trajectory of their lives. She says that she cannot help anyone if they are not
    ready to
    help themselves.</p>
<p>Dr. Anveshna's story is a powerful testament to the resilience and determination required to challenge and change the
    status quo. Her journey embodies the profound impact education and perseverance can have on the world. As she
    continues
    to break barriers and forge paths for future generations, Dr. Anveshna remains a pivotal figure in the landscape of
    educational reform and an inspiring role model for women everywhere.
</p>
<p>She shares an anecdote about when she was returning from TIFR’s campus in Colaba, Mumbai after watching a play at 1
    am
    to HBCSE in Mankhurd, Mumbai. She was traveling in the Mumbai local train and had been thinking about the play. The
    cool
    breeze was exhilarating and after she reached her place, it struck her that in that hour-long journey, she was alone
    in
    the train, and not once did it cross her mind that it could be unsafe. It brought a smile to her face! She quips-
    “the
    difference between the ‘dissection-needle’ commute and the ‘needle-free’/’non-alert mode’ commute is one of a
    mindset of
    the society, one that enables terror and the other that lets you be. It requires a hell lot of effort to change
    that. I
    am doing my job and I need more help.”

<p>This blog seeks not just to tell her story but to motivate others to believe that no barrier is too large to
    overcome—and that the pursuit of education and equality is a noble, impactful journey.

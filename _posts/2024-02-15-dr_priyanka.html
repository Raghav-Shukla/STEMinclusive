<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/priyanka-bagade-576b77ba/" target="_blank">Dr. Priyanka
        Bagade</a> is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at IIT Kanpur. She is one of 4 women professors of
    the Computer Science and Engineering Department of IIT Kanpur.</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">Childhood</h2>
<p>Frequent relocations marked Dr. Priyanka Bagade's childhood due to her father's job. Despite facing health challenges
    that affected her attendance and exam performance until the fourth grade, she remained dedicated to her studies,
    displaying a keen interest in subjects that involved reasoning and logic.</p>
<p>By the fifth grade, Dr. Priyanka's health improved, sparking a renewed enthusiasm for learning. Excelling in science,
    she opted against a medical career due to her aversion to hospitals, stemming from her childhood experiences.</p>
<p>In her later years of schooling, Dr. Priyanka's fascination with electronics grew, leading her to specialize in the
    subject. This interest evolved into a passion for embedded systems, prompting her to pursue a degree in Electronics
    and
    Telecommunication Engineering for her undergraduate studies. This decision reflected her commitment to exploring the
    complexities of embedded platforms and networks, laying the foundation for a promising career in engineering and
    technology.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Career</h2>
<p>She worked at Cognizant for a few years. Here, she began to reassess her career path. Her curiosity about programming
    led her to delve deeper into the field, but she soon realized that the nature of her work was more managerial and
    monotonous rather than technical and fulfilling. She managed a team of around 200 people and wanted a change with
    more
    direct involvement in the technical aspects of her field.</p>
<p>With a keen interest in advancing her knowledge and skills, she decided to pursue further education in the United
    States. Recognizing that embedded systems, a field she was passionate about, fell under the purview of computer
    science
    in the US, she applied for a Ph.D. program in the Computer Science Department at Arizona State University.</p>
<p>During her doctoral studies, she immersed herself in the healthcare sector, where her research project was funded by
    the
    Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a significant achievement that underscored the relevance and importance of her
    work.
    Additionally, she seized the opportunity to intern at the FDA, gaining invaluable insights into how engineers can
    contribute to healthcare projects. While working with ventilators, she worked on how to control and monitor them
    remotely. This introduced her to some more advanced mathematical concepts like Non Linear Differential Equations,
    which
    she found very interesting.</p>
<p>Before her work at the FDA, she dedicated 8 to 10 months of intense effort to a project involving EEG and ECG
    signals,
    putting in long hours of work each day. Despite her hard work, she didn't achieve the success she had hoped for
    initially. However, a valuable insight from a friend studying psychology which is a very different field sparked a
    new
    approach for her. Inspired by this new perspective from psychology, she decided to apply it to her research on EEG
    and
    ECG signals.</p>
<p>Previously, researchers had been using ECG signals to encrypt data. However, her innovative approach led her to break
    this encryption method. Recognizing the significance of her breakthrough, she filed for a patent for her new method.
    This experience taught her the importance of persistence in overcoming challenges and finding novel solutions.</p>
<p>Post her PhD, she transitioned to a role at Intel as a computer vision architect. Here, she focused on developing
    sensors and their applications. Joining a team that directly engaged with customers from various sectors such as
    healthcare, automotive, etc., she played a crucial role in solving their technical challenges. She applied the
    concepts
    she had learned throughout her education to innovate and find solutions.</p>
<p>During her five years at Intel, she had a positive experience with her manager. Recognizing the importance of
    autonomy
    and freedom in her work, she appreciated that her manager never pushed her into uninteresting projects. This freedom
    allowed her to excel and contribute effectively to her team's goals. She further realized that academia too provided
    the
    freedom for unrestrained exploration and innovation, ideal conditions for her to excel.</p>
<p>Despite her success at Intel, her desire to return to India remained strong. She aimed to utilize her expertise in
    healthcare to address specific issues faced by the Indian population like intestinal tuberculosis, which is
    prevalent
    only in India. This aspiration drove her to plan her return and contribute to solving healthcare challenges in her
    home
    country.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Advice for future generations</h2>
<p>Dr. Priyanka Bagade's journey offers valuable advice for future students:</p>
<p>1. Choose Your Path wisely: Understand the significance of selecting courses that align with your interests and
    career
    aspirations during your undergraduate studies. Be deliberate in your choices and prioritize subjects that will equip
    you
    with the necessary skills and knowledge for your desired career path.</p>
<p>2. Perseverance is Key: Don't allow setbacks or failures to deter you. Life is unpredictable, and success often
    requires
    resilience and persistence. Keep working hard, stay committed to your goals, and remain open to unexpected
    opportunities
    that may arise. Sometimes even on working very hard, you may not get expected results and may end up on the lower
    end of
    the bell curve. Do not give up at that time.</p>
<p>3. Maintain Humility and Kindness: Strive for success but remember to remain humble and compassionate. Treat others
    with
    respect and empathy, and prioritize genuine human connections in your personal and professional interactions.</p>
<p>4. Don't Let Gender Define You: Rise above societal expectations and stereotypes. Regardless of gender, focus on your
    abilities, talents, and passions. Embrace your identity as a human being first and foremost, and let your skills and

<p><a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/new/mini-chandran" target="_blank">Dr. Mini Chandran</a> is the HOD of the Humanities
    and Social Sciences Department of IIT Kanpur. She is a professor of Literature.</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">Childhood</h2>
<p>During her childhood years, her hobbies revolved around the enchanting world of stories. Listening to tales sparked
    her
    imagination, while delving into the pages of books became her cherished pastime. Among her favorites were the
    captivating narratives found within the pages of Chanda Mama magazines and the timeless tales spun by Enid Blyton.
    Unlike many of her peers, she harbored a disdain for movies, preferring instead the solace and depth found within
    the
    pages of a book.</p>
<p>As the youngest child in her family, she often sought refuge in the company of literature. Books became her
    companions,
    offering solace and a sense of belonging. It was through these pages that she found not just entertainment, but a
    profound connection to the world of words and ideas.</p>
<p>Naturally drawn towards the realm of literature, she pursued her passion further by studying BA in English Literature
    at
    the esteemed University of Kerala. Here, her love for the written word flourished as she immersed herself in the
    rich
    tapestry of literary works spanning centuries and continents. This academic journey served to deepen her
    understanding
    and appreciation for the power of language and storytelling, shaping her into the avid reader and lover of
    literature
    she is today.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Career</h2>
<p>She also decided to pursue her Master’s in English Literature from University of Kerala. Following her completion of
    a
    Master's degree, she embarked on a professional journey as a journalist, eager to make a meaningful contribution
    through
    her writing. However, her initial stint at a women's magazine left her feeling unfulfilled. The superficiality of
    the
    content, focused primarily on cosmetics and recipes, failed to resonate with her deeper aspirations. She longed to
    delve
    into the real issues that women grappled with, to shed light on their struggles and triumphs.</p>
<p>Discontent with her current role, she tried transitioning to a newspaper. Unfortunately she didn’t get an opportunity
    here. Nevertheless, she remained resolute in her pursuit of meaningful journalism, determined to tackle substantive
    issues. This period of transition coincided with the arrival of her first child.</p>
<p>After the arrival of her first child, she made the decision to delve into further research instead. Juggling the
    responsibilities of parenthood and her doctoral studies while simultaneously also working a job became her new
    reality.
    Remarkably, she managed to balance these significant commitments with finesse, demonstrating exceptional skill in
    managing multiple roles simultaneously.</p>
<p>Upon entering IIT Kanpur, she found herself drawn to the rich tapestry of Indian literature, particularly Malayalam
    literature, which ignited a newfound passion within her. Intrigued by the art of translation, she embarked on a
    journey
    to bring the beauty of Indian literary works to a wider audience through her translations.</p>
<p>In addition to her fascination with literature, she developed a keen interest in Indian aesthetics, delving into the
    intricacies of Indian theories surrounding literature, reading, and the nuances of literary response.</p>
<p>Her tenure as a lecturer at IIT Kanpur proved transformative, as she discovered her true potential in the realm of
    teaching. Surrounded by bright and enthusiastic students, she came to realize the profound impact of a nurturing
    learning environment. Firmly believing that good students make for good teachers, she embraced her role with zeal,
    recognizing that she possessed the ability to inspire and educate in every sense of the word.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Challenges she faced at IITK</h2>
<p>Transitioning to IIT Kanpur posed a significant challenge for her, as she grappled with cultural differences and the
    unfamiliar climate, compounded by the fact that she didn't speak Hindi. Adjusting to this new environment demanded
    resilience and perseverance, particularly in the face of rigorous academic expectations.</p>
<p>To distinguish herself in this intellectual landscape, striving to contribute novel ideas to her field. Despite the
    demanding nature of her work, she found solace in the supportive and nurturing workplace environment at IIT Kanpur.
    Despite the challenges, she found fulfilment and happiness in her time at IIT Kanpur, recognizing the institution's
    emphasis on cutting-edge research and innovative thinking as both daunting and invigorating.</p>
<p>Navigating the corridors of IIT Kanpur, she encountered yet another obstacle in the form of pervasive gender bias. In
    a
    predominantly male-dominated environment, she faced dismissive attitudes toward women, which permeated various
    aspects
    of campus life. Moreover, she confronted the prevailing prejudice against humanities and social sciences within a
    predominantly tech-focused institution, necessitating additional efforts to assert the value of her field.</p>
<p>Despite her remarkable accomplishments, she found herself continuously battling against entrenched biases and
    stereotypes. The subtle yet pervasive nature of these prejudices became evident in everyday interactions, such as
    the
    lack of acknowledgment from security guards, who readily saluted male professors but failed to extend the same
    courtesy
    to their female counterparts. Though often overlooked or disregarded, these instances served as constant reminders
    of
    the entrenched gender disparities that persist in society. Nevertheless, she navigated these challenges with
    resilience
    and fortitude, acknowledging the existence of these hidden biases while refusing to let them hinder her progress.
</p>
<p>She made history as the first woman warden in charge of the girls' hostel at IIT Kanpur. Before her, the hostel was
    overseen by male wardens-in-charge due to doubts about women's ability to handle certain situations involving male
    hostel staff. But she proved them wrong by handling a scenario involving male mess workers on her own. Her success
    prompted her to challenge the norm, advocating for an all-women core team to manage the girl’s hostel. Eventually,
    she
    became the first woman warden-in-charge of the girl’s hostel, breaking barriers and inspiring change within the
    institution.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Advice for future generations</h2>
<p>Her advice for the younger generation, especially girls, is rooted in the importance of asserting individuality and
    authenticity. She emphasizes the need for confidence in one's own identity and the courage to resist the pressure to
    conform. Too often, she observes, girls find themselves torn between societal expectations and their own desires,
    leading them to sacrifice their true selves in the pursuit of acceptance.</p>
<p>In today's world, she acknowledges, the landscape is vastly different from years past, largely due to the pervasive
    influence of social media. The constant exposure to curated images and ideals on these platforms exacerbates peer
    pressure, making it even more challenging for girls to stay true to themselves.</p>
<p>She advocates for following one's passions and interests, highlighting the significance of pursuing paths that
    resonate
    personally.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Notes of gratitude</h2>
<p>She expresses deep gratitude towards her parents for their unwavering support and understanding, emphasizing their
    role
    in allowing her to pursue her passions without pressure or constraint.</p>
<p>Her appreciation extends to Professor Hridaya Kumari, whose guidance illuminated the transformative power of
    literature,
    shaping her understanding of its potential and significance.</p>
<p>She also acknowledges Professor Ayyappa Panikkar, who was a poet himself, and whose mentorship expanded her artistic
    horizons, introducing her to new possibilities within the realm of creativity.</p>
<p>Her heartfelt thanks are directed towards Professor Chandrika Balan, her PhD advisor and a notable writer herself,
    whose
    mentorship and expertise guided her through the rigors of doctoral studies and beyond.</p>
<p>Lastly, she expresses profound gratitude to her husband for his unwavering support and encouragement, standing by her
    side through every challenge and triumph.</p>

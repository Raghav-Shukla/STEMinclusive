<p><a href="https://home.iitk.ac.in/~smitra/" target="_blank">Dr. Sharmishta Mitra</a> is a Professor in the department
    of
    Mathematics and Statistics at IIT Kanpur. Her research
    interests include order statistics and its applications, order estimation of nested non-linear models and
    econometrics.
</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">Childhood</h2>
<p>Growing up in Kolkata, I attended South Point School, renowned as the city's first co-educational institution. My
    father, a mechanical engineer, worked for an Indo-German company, while my mother, despite her academic
    qualifications
    in Bengali literature and classical music, remained a homemaker due to my father's busy schedule. Despite the
    challenges, my upbringing was positive, and my school days were memorable, although the environment was highly
    competitive, especially regarding preparation for engineering and medical entrances.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Academics and Career</h2>
<p>Despite societal pressure to pursue engineering or medical sciences, I was more inclined towards subjects like
    languages, mathematics, and history. When it came to choosing my academic stream after the 10th grade, I opted for
    mathematics and economics, aiming for a career in financial analysis. Despite skepticism from others, I enrolled in
    Statistics in
    Presidency College, known for its history and notable alumni, including Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee. I chose
    statistics over economics, despite societal pressure, and remained committed to my decision, driven by the applied
    nature of statistics and its potential for creativity. I reflect on my exposure to eminent professors and the
    academic atmosphere at
    Presidency College, which significantly influenced my academic trajectory.</p>
<p>After completing my undergraduate studies, I became disillusioned with the treatment of Statistics during my Master's
    Program at Baliganj Science College, where the focus was more on theoretical aspects than practical applications. I
    decided to drop out and my life took a significant turn when I learned about the opportunity to pursue a Master's
    degree in Statistics
    at IIT Kanpur through Professor Rahul Mukherjee, an alumnus of Presidency College. Despite limited information about
    the
    program, I decided to take the entrance test with a group of fellow students, ultimately leading to our selection
    and
    enrollment at IIT Kanpur.
</p>
<p>The process of applying for and securing admission to IIT Kanpur's Statistics program was challenging yet exciting.
    The
    rigorous selection process, including a written test and interview, and the overwhelming reactions from family
    members
    upon receiving acceptance were significant moments. Despite initial apprehensions, my peers and I embraced the
    opportunity, recognizing the unique academic environment at IIT Kanpur.
</p>
<p>Following completion of our Masters, my husband, Amit, and I both decided to pursue our PhDs at the
    same
    institution. Despite other opportunities, we chose to remain at our alma mater due to our strong connection to the
    place
    and its academic environment. Amit excelled academically throughout his educational
    journey, becoming Professor Debashish Kundu's first PhD student.
</p>
<p>Post-PhD, we had various options, including postdoctoral fellowships abroad, but fate had other plans. Despite
    uncertainties about our future income and career paths, we followed our hearts and tied the knot. We went on to work
    at the Reserve Bank of India, working on advanced financial modelling of large amounts of data. Subsequently, Amit
    was
    offered a postdoctoral fellowship at Uppsala University in Sweden, while I chose to take a leave without pay to
    spend
    time with our newborn child. Eventually, Amit joined IIT Bombay as faculty, embarking on his academic journey, while
    I
    returned to my
    job at the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
</p>
<p>The landscape of statistics careers in India was small, with limited opportunities available outside academia. I
    eventually transitioned back to academia after a decade-long hiatus, accepting a visiting faculty position
    at
    my alma mater, IIT Kanpur. This transition was not without challenges, but the support and camaraderie of my
    colleagues,
    who
    were once my teachers, made the journey smoother. Despite starting my regular faculty position relatively later in
    my
    career, I harbored no regrets, as my previous experiences enriched my understanding of the subject and its
    real-world
    applications.
</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">Reflections</h2>
<p>Upon joining the faculty, I faced questions about my research plans, which traditionally should emphasize theoretical
    rigor rather
    than
    applied work. Reflecting on my journey, I realized that my PhD research focused heavily on theoretical mathematical
    statistics, while my work at RBI involved econometric modeling. Despite external expectations, I now focus more on
    reliability and survival analysis, which bridges my original research area with practical applications.
</p>

<p>As I approach the final phase of my professional career, I contemplate the evolution of statistics careers in India.
    The
    increasing demand for professionals skilled in financial modeling and data analysis reflects the growing importance
    of
    mathematics and statistics in various industries. With advancements in technology and computing power, the ability
    to
    extract meaningful insights from data has become paramount, leading to lucrative career opportunities in fields such
    as
    high-frequency trading and financial analytics.
</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">Advice for High School Students</h2>
<p>Reflecting on my own career choices, I offer advice to high school students, particularly girls, emphasizing the
    importance of financial independence and pursuing professions that support their financial stability. While building
    a
    successful career is essential, it should not overshadow other aspects of life. I encourage individuals to follow
    their
    passions and dreams, even if it means making unconventional choices or swimming against the current.
</p>
<p>Despite the sacrifices and compromises inherent in balancing personal and professional priorities, I emphasize the
    value
    of following one's heart and prioritizing personal fulfillment. For me, the decision to take a year-long leave
    without
    pay to spend time with my young child, despite its potential impact on my professional trajectory, was a deeply
    fulfilling choice. In hindsight, I cherish the experiences and memories gained during that time, recognizing them as
    invaluable moments in my personal journey.

<h2 class="section-heading">Notes of Gratitude</h2>
<p>Expressing gratitude to influential figures in my life, I acknowledge the pivotal roles played by my parents and
    teachers at various stages of my journey. Their guidance and support sculpted me into an independent individual
    capable
    of making adjustments when necessary. Particularly, my mother's sacrifices and teachings instilled in me the
    importance
    of prioritizing family alongside professional aspirations.
</p>
<p>Emphasizing the significance of a strong support system, I recognize the invaluable contributions of my family,
    especially my spouse, children, and in-laws. The unwavering support from loved ones, coupled with a conducive family
    environment, facilitates the pursuit of professional endeavors, particularly for women who often juggle multiple
    responsibilities.
</p>
<p>Concluding the interview, I express gratitude to my colleagues at IIT, who, despite my decade-long absence, welcomed
    me
    warmly and provided invaluable support. Their encouragement instilled confidence in my ability to reintegrate into
    academic life successfully.

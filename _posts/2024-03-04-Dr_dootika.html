<p><a href="https://dvats.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Dootika Vats</a> is an Assistant
    professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at IIT Kanpur. Her research
    interests include Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Output Analysis for stochastic simulation and stochastic optimisation
    algorithms.</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">A brief about your childhood</h2>
<p>I was born in the US in 1990 into an academic family. At that time, my father was a postdoc. When I was just 10
    months
    old, my family moved to IIT Kanpur, where I spent my entire childhood. Growing up on the campus provided me with a
    safe
    environment and numerous opportunities for extracurricular activities. I did my schooling at Virendra Swarup
    Education
    Center, which was located outside the campus. In our household, the emphasis on studying for the sake of learning,
    rather than focusing on grades or any other external factors, was of prime importance.</p>
<p>My mother, a mathematician and school principal, played a significant role in my upbringing. She never allowed me to
    memorize anything and encouraged me to understand whatever I learned. One of the faintest memories that I can recall
    is
    when my mother caught me rote learning multiplication tables, and she simply wouldn't accept that. Her emphasis was
    always on grasping concepts.</p>
<p>I engaged in various sports, whether I had company or not. I spent long hours practicing shooting hoops with a
    basketball and even bowled 22 yards in my garage, even if there was no batter on the other side. I always kept
    myself
    physically engaged and also attended dance and music classes.</p>
<p>I gave my 10th standard board exams in 2005. During that time, there was a prevalent stereotype that all science
    stream
    students commonly enroll in JEE coaching and prepare for JEE. Despite being in the science stream and the fact that
    I
    lived in an IIT campus, I went against this stereotype for the sheer fact that I was disinterested in this JEE
    setup. My
    parents received my decision with confusion and dilemma but I was firm. I told them that I liked science and math
    and
    wished to pursue these subjects. I told them that they had taught me that in education, knowledge for the sake of
    knowledge is important. My parents still suggested the idea of attending JEE coaching even if I was not going to sit
    for
    the JEE, but I felt that this approach would simply be a wastage of money.</p>
<p>So, I did my 11th and 12th without a single coaching and subsequently joined the programme of BA Mathematics at Lady
    Shri Ram (LSR) College in Delhi University. LSR had unknowingly shaped my personality in multiple ways. Firstly,
    being a
    girls only college, I learnt to just be a student in a classroom rather than a female student in a classroom. I was
    able
    to realize this during my higher education. During my masters and Phd, there were very few women in my classes.
    Being in
    the minority has an impact on the behavior of female students. They avoid asking questions that they deem as being
    ‘stupid’ because they feel that might wrongly represent their gender in class. But I never faced this problem
    because I
    identified myself as simply a student in the classroom. My gender did not matter. Therefore, I would actively
    interact
    with faculty and be myself. Secondly, the fact that my college was essentially a liberal arts college with very few
    STEM
    majors, I would often engage in diverse conversations with my friends in other streams such as Psychology, History,
    Political science etc. That was a very liberating experience.</p>
<p>I had pursued my Masters in Statistics in Rutgers University and subsequently completed my Phd from the University of
    Minnesota under the guidance of Prof. Galin Jones.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Any challenges you faced along the way and how did you overcome them?</h2>
<p>I faced multiple failures in my academic journey, to which I responded with resilience. After completing my
    undergrad, I
    applied to 19 Ph.D. programs in the United States and received rejections from all of them. The admissions committee
    at
    Rutgers University reached out to me, offering a Master's degree in Mathematics instead of a Ph.D. I accepted the
    offer
    but encountered difficulties with the curriculum, as the academic structure of a Master's degree at Rutgers differed
    significantly from that of Master's programs in Indian institutions. Being the sole Master's student among 8 Ph.D.
    students, I struggled to adapt to the academics, gradually losing confidence in myself as the first semester
    progressed.</p>
<p>Attempting courses from other disciplines, I developed an interest in Statistics. After one semester, I approached
    the
    admissions committee and requested a change from a Master's in Mathematics to a Master's in Statistics.
    Subsequently, I
    completed my Master's in the remaining three semesters. In my subsequent application attempts, I applied for 14
    Ph.D.
    programs, receiving acceptance from the University of Minnesota but rejections from the rest. These setbacks served
    as
    mere stepping stones for me.</p>
<p>Another set of challenges involves explicit and implicit biases. Concerning explicit biases, I have seldom
    experienced
    put-downs or victimization, partly due to my careful selection of colleagues. Nonetheless, I recall an instance at
    an
    Indian Society Conference where it took me 10 minutes to explain to some Phds that I was a theoretical statistician,
    a
    concept they found challenging to grasp due to the underrepresentation of women in the field. Implicit biases
    persist
    due to the default patriarchal system present in every setup, manifesting in day-to-day occurrences.</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">What advice would you give high school students?</h2>
<p>As I delve into the conversation about career advice for students, my focus shifts to the crucial aspect of making
    intentional choices in academic fields. I wholeheartedly encourage fellow students not to succumb to societal
    pressures
    when selecting STEM fields, emphasizing the significance of intentional decisions. I advocate for the exploration of
    non-STEM disciplines such as public policy, sociology, philosophy, and political science, emphasizing that the
    financial
    aspect of future prospects should be acknowledged but not prioritized over genuine interest.</p>
<p>My advice extends beyond non-STEM enthusiasts; I urge STEM students to consider venturing into non-STEM fields if
    they
    harbor genuine interest and passion. The boundaries between disciplines can be fluid, and exploring diverse
    interests
    can be enriching.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I caution against blindly following advice and stress the importance of seeking guidance from
    individuals
    with similar motivations and successful experiences in their respective fields. Each student's journey is unique,
    and
    aligning advice with personal aspirations ensures a more fulfilling and authentic career path.</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">Notes of Gratitude to people who helped you along the way</h2>
<p>There are so many people whom I want to thank. Firstly, my parents, especially my mother who instilled a way of
    learning
    that focused on conceptual clarity. That is something that remained with me forever.</p>
<p>Secondly, I would like to express my gratitude to Prof. Monica Singh, who was a professor in my undergraduate
    college.
    Me and 8 other students asked her to offer a specific elective that our college had never offered before. It was a
    course on number theory, and initially, she hesitated. Despite her reluctance, our persistent group of nine students
    kept pleading, as we were keen on avoiding another course, Boolean Algebra. Eventually, she agreed, and then she
    went on
    to learn the subject herself. Subsequently, she not only mastered it but also taught it. Now, being on the other
    side as
    a faculty member, I can only imagine the tremendous effort it must have taken. Working at a teaching college means
    dealing with significant teaching responsibilities and hours. Yet, she would go home, dedicate time to reading and
    learning about a topic she initially didn't know well. She took on the challenge just because the nine of us,
    persistent
    as we were, wanted to learn it. She went out of her way, showing initiative and genuine care. It's a memory that
    remains
    vivid for me, especially now that I am in a similar position. I realize how easy it is to lose that sense of care in
    this job. It's truly insightful, and it's something I find challenging to forget.</p>
<p>My PhD advisor, Professor Galin Jones at Minnesota, profoundly influenced my perspective on research and academic
    life.
    Under his guidance, we seldom delved into active research discussions, and I never found myself writing on his
    board.
    Our conversations revolved around broader aspects of academia—what it means to review a paper, attend a conference,
    critique a paper, or run a department. In reflecting on this career, I've come to realize the importance of people
    and
    time management. The role has shifted towards effective management of PhD students, requiring a humane approach that
    acknowledges individual differences. Recognizing varied needs, managing emotions, and understanding when to push or
    provide positive reinforcement have become integral aspects.</p>
<p>To excel in this profession, it's increasingly less about individual research and more about developing strong people
    management skills. Professor Jones had a significant impact on my academic perspective, emphasizing the intricate
    balance between academic excellence and effective human interaction.</p>

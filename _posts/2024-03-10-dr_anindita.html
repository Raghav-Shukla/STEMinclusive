<p><a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/new/anindita-chakrabarti" target="_blank">Dr. Anindita Chakrabarti</a> is a Professor
    of Sociology in the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences at IIT Kanpur.</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">Childhood</h2>
<p>Dr. Anindita Chakrabarti's upbringing unfolded in a middle-class neighborhood in Kolkata, where many residents held
    occupations as teachers and professors. In this environment, a profound emphasis was placed on academics. Retired
    individuals in the community contributed by teaching various arts such as music and painting. During Durga Puja
    celebrations, the neighborhood buzzed with literary activities and theatrical performances, with Dr. Anindita
    immersing
    herself in the plays of Tagore.
</p>
<p>Despite being expected by many to pursue a path in the sciences due to her academic excellence, Dr. Anindita opted
    for
    social sciences, a decision met with full support from her parents. They actively invested in her education,
    fostering
    her intellectual growth and encouraging her interests. Her father, a professor, and her mother, a teacher, played
    pivotal roles in nurturing her academic and personal development.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What made her interested in Sociology</h2>
<p>Dr. Anindita Chakrabarti's choice to study sociology was influenced by a professor who sparked her interest in the
    field, despite the prevalent questioning of the scope of literature in her middle-class environment. Her exposure to
    psychology during her plus two education further kindled her curiosity, leading her to join the British Council
    library
    to delve deeper into the subject.
</p>
<p>She joined the newly established sociology program at the University of Calcutta, which served as an eye-opener for
    her.
    This initial experience with sociology motivated her to pursue a M.A. and M.Phil. in Sociology at the University of
    Delhi. The decision to pursue a PhD, however, was a significant one, considering her wide range of interests.</p>
<p>After spending two years working in the social sector, Dr. Anindita gained clarity on her academic path. She focused
    her
    studies on volunteerism, seeking to understand what motivates people to volunteer. Her research eventually expanded
    to
    include the role of religion in organizing volunteers, leading to the publication of her books "Faith and Social
    Movements" in 2017 and "Religion and Secularities" in 2020. Dr. Anindita also collaborated on a forthcoming book
    titled
    "Gold in India" alongside Barbara Harris White.</p>
<p>Sociology, in Dr. Aninditaâ€™s perspective, offers a lens to comprehend the intricacies of the world beyond mere
    political
    debates, delving into the underlying social dynamics and structures that shape human interactions. Her teaching
    experience at IITK highlighted the rewarding challenge of simplifying complex social science concepts into easily
    digestible forms for undergraduate students. Balancing the extremes of teaching PhD and undergraduate students
    ultimately deepened her understanding of sociology's relevance in bridging academic intricacies with real-world
    applications.</p>
<p>In reflecting on her journey, Dr. Anindita underscores the importance of highlighting the contributions of the
    Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) department, recognizing the integral role it plays in understanding the world
    beyond mere political discourse.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Her involvement with Animal Welfare Group</h2>
<p>As the warden of a girls' hostel, Dr. Anindita Chakraborty confronted a significant challenge with the escalating
    number
    of unsterilized dogs, a problem that intensified during the COVID pandemic. Despite her initial apprehension and
    fear of
    dogs, she was deeply impressed by the relentless dedication of Animal Welfare Group volunteers who worked
    tirelessly,
    often in opposition to other professors and hostel wardens, to ensure the safety and welfare of these animals.
    Witnessing their selfless efforts inspired her to take action and contribute to her community by addressing the dog
    issue in the hostel.</p>
<p>Dr. Anindita recognized the complexities involved in simply relocating dogs, as this often led to more aggressive
    dogs
    taking their place, exacerbating the problem. This experience highlighted the need for a more comprehensive
    approach,
    emphasizing the importance of not just treating the symptoms but addressing the root causes of such issues.</p>
<p>She also realized the need for greater awareness and sensitization among hostel residents and staff, advocating for a
    more holistic understanding and proactive measures to create a safer and more harmonious environment for both humans
    and
    animals.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Dr. Anindita's journey in dealing with the hostel's dog problem underscored the interconnectedness of
    social
    and environmental issues, illustrating the importance of collective action, empathy, and informed decision-making in
    fostering a more inclusive and sustainable community.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">How will sociology evolve in the future?</h2>
<p>Dr. Anindita Chakraborty envisions the future evolution of sociology with a strong emphasis on indigenous research
    within the Indian context. She observes that much of the existing sociological research is derived from Western
    societies, and she advocates for a shift towards generating more insights from Indian society, particularly in
    critical
    areas such as healthcare, education, and judiciary. This shift would entail a deeper exploration and understanding
    of
    the unique social structures, dynamics, and challenges within India, offering valuable perspectives that can inform
    public policy and decision-making on a broader scale.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, Dr. Anindita emphasizes the importance of young people actively reflecting on and critically engaging
    with
    everyday life. This approach encourages a deeper comprehension of the underlying mechanisms that drive societal
    functions and behaviors. By fostering a culture of critical thinking and analysis, sociology can evolve to provide
    more
    nuanced and contextually relevant insights into the intricacies of society, ultimately contributing to more
    effective
    and equitable public policies.</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">Advice for future generations</h2>
<p>Dr. Anindita Chakraborty encourages individuals to critically engage with the world around them by immersing
    themselves
    in extensive reading and thoughtful reflection. She emphasizes the transformative power of books, citing "Democracy
    in
    America" as a profound example that delves into the origins and evolution of democracy. Through reading, individuals
    can
    connect with great minds across space and time, gaining a deeper understanding of societal
    complexities
    and historical contexts.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, Dr. Anindita advocates for visiting libraries and exploring a wide range of literature to broaden one's
    perspectives and insights into society at large. This engagement goes beyond the individual level, urging
    individuals to
    ponder meaningful questions that spark curiosity and drive intellectual exploration. She highlights the journey of
    inquiry and discovery as inherently fascinating, as it involves unraveling layers of knowledge and understanding
    that
    contribute to a more nuanced comprehension of societal dynamics and challenges.</p>

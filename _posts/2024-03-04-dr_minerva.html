<p><a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/new/minerva-mukhopadhyay" target="_blank">Dr. Minerva Mukhopadhyay</a> is an
    Assistant professor in the department of Mathematics and Statistics at IIT Kanpur.
    Her
    research interests include high dimensional asymptotics, variable selection and prediction, density estimation,
    Bayesian
    modelling.</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">Childhood</h2>
<p>I was born and brought up in a close-knit nuclear family in Kolkata. I studied in a missionary school under the
    Sarada
    Mission. During that time, there weren’t many extracurricular activities in my school, but I still used to engage in
    fun
    activities like trekking in addition to diligently pursuing my academics.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What inspired you to pursue your field, and what was your journey?
</h2>
<p>My interest in mathematics sparked during high school, largely due to an inspiring teacher who delved into the depth
    of
    concepts, beyond mere formulas and arithmetic statements. His name was Bhasker Bose. He could actually show me that
    there is randomness in whatever we see. That is, everything is random and everything comes with a chance. This got
    me
    quite motivated to work in statistics and also academics attracted me. I decided that I would pursue a Phd in
    statistics
    and then subsequently pursue a job in statistics. By the time I finished my Phd, I was all set to become an
    academician.
    I also had wonderful teachers in my undergraduate and graduate schools like Arnab Chakraborty and Anup Goswami.
</p>
<p>So, if I talk about my academic trajectory, I pursued a Bachelors in Mathematics from St. Xavier’s college, Masters
    in statistics from Calcutta University, Phd from ISI and lastly Post Doc. from Duke University in North Carolina,
    USA.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Any challenges you faced along the way and how did you overcome them?
</h2>
<p>One of the major challenges that I faced was that until my Ph.D., I had studied in Bengali medium and did not know
    English. I struggled heavily during my postdoctoral research in the USA on account of language issues. It was my
    resilience that allowed me to sail through.
</p>
<p>I have faced multiple challenges in various spheres of life, whether related to my family, academia, or as a student.
    I
    recall advice given to me by one of my Ph.D. guides at ISI, Mr. C.M. Mukti, who used to say, 'Do your job and
    everything
    will follow.' I have followed his advice ever since and would suggest it to others as well. If you know what your
    goal
    is, you can arrive at that goal in a different way if one path or another does not work out for you.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What advice would you give
    high school students?
</h2>
<p>A big change is underway. With AI, I believe not only students, but also professors must evolve. We must be updated
    everyday. We must know the latest technologies, whether we like it or not. We must harness these technologies to our
    advantage.
</p>
<p>As an individual navigating through academia or any field, it's imperative to delve deep into the subjects or areas
    of
    interest. It's not merely about skimming the surface but rather about immersing oneself in the intricacies, nuances,
    and
    complexities that lie beneath. By diving deep, one can uncover layers of understanding, perspectives, and insights
    that
    might otherwise remain undiscovered.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Notes of Gratitude to people who helped you along the way.
</h2>
<p>Expressing gratitude for my academic journey, I acknowledge the role of my students in my own learning process.
    Teaching
    has provided me with opportunities to delve deeper into subjects and gain insights from my students' inquiries. I
    express gratitude towards the institutions I've been a part of, particularly highlighting the enriching experience
    at
    IIT.

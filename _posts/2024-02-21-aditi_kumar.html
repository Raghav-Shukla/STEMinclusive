<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditi-kumar-365435112/" target="_blank">Aditi Kumar</a> is an alumnus of IIT
    Kanpur. She is Assistant Vice President at Indian Angel Network Pvt. Ltd.</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">Childhood</h2>
<p>I hail from the small town of Muzaffarnagar nestled in the western part of Uttar Pradesh. My educational journey
    commenced at a convent school where I completed my schooling until the tenth grade. Subsequently, I transitioned to
    Noida to pursue my eleventh and twelfth-grade education.</p>
<p>The pivotal moment that sparked my interest in Biotechnology dates back to my time in the eleventh grade when I had
    to
    select an optional subject. Presented with choices including computer science, sculpture, economics, among others, I
    initially opted for computer science, influenced by my sister. However, it took a little while for me to realize
    that
    computer science wasn't my calling.</p>
<p>I always wanted to be a Doctor since childhood but then realized the long years of study and hard work it would take
    to
    become one was something I didn’t want. Therefore, I chose engineering and made a shift towards exploring
    Biotechnology.
    Engaging in captivating experiments like blood testing, DNA isolation, and gel electrophoresis during my high school
    years further fuelled my interest.</p>
<p>While many students typically encounter such hands-on experiences in Biotechnology during their college years, my
    early
    exposure served as a catalyst, solidifying my resolve to pursue Biotechnology engineering. Thus, I embarked on my
    academic journey, getting a B. Tech in Biotechnology from Lovely Professional University and ultimately graduating
    with
    an M.Tech degree from IIT Kanpur, with the thesis supervised by Professor Amitabha Bandopadhyay. Subsequently, I
    ventured into the professional realm, joining the Startup Innovation and Incubation Center (SIIC) at IIT Kanpur in
    July
    2017, marking the commencement of a fulfilling chapter in my career.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">How did you get interested in venture capital?</h2>
<p>My interest in venture capital evolved from a journey that initially seemed destined for academia and research.
    During
    my B.Tech days, like many aspiring biotech students, my vision was to pursue a Ph.D. abroad and eventually join
    esteemed
    companies in pharmaceuticals or food technology. The prospect of becoming a professor never appealed to me. After
    graduating from Lovely Professional University and qualifying for GATE, securing a position at IIT Kanpur was a
    significant step towards realizing my academic aspirations.</p>
<p>However, an unexpected opportunity arose when Professor Amitabha told me about a role at the SIIC, which promised
    extensive travel—a concept that intrigued me, especially in the context of the increasing trend of solo travel in
    India.
    Despite initially intending to pursue further studies abroad, I decided to take a detour and explore the startup
    ecosystem within the country.</p>
<p>The startup world ignited my passion from day one, presenting a boundless opportunity for learning and growth.
    Through
    my work, I came to realize that life extends far beyond the realms of patent filings and research publications.
    Startups
    are pioneers in innovation, tirelessly working to transform intellectual ideas into commercially viable,
    scientifically
    driven products. What excited me most was the profound societal impact these ventures could have, whether through
    preventive diagnostics, novel drugs, or other groundbreaking solutions.</p>
<p>During my tenure at the incubation center, I immersed myself in various aspects of startup operations beyond
    traditional
    fund management. This hands-on experience allowed me to intimately understand the challenges faced by founders, not
    only
    on a technical level but also in navigating the complexities of the business landscape. I discovered my strength in
    relationship management and the ability to translate complex deep-tech concepts into language understandable to
    non-technical stakeholders.</p>
<p>So, there I found my niche—I witnessed the real-time impact of my work unfolding before my eyes. That's what truly
    excited me. You see, typically, a startup embarks on its journey within an incubation center, where it receives
    support
    and guidance to lay the groundwork for success. Eventually, these startups spread their wings, securing funding and
    establishing their own operations. Inspired by this trajectory, I realized I wanted to follow a similar path.</p>
<p>While I was well-versed in the realm of grants—writing them, securing them, and allocating them—I felt compelled to
    broaden my expertise to include the investment side of the equation. I aspired to become a well-rounded professional
    capable of not only providing technical guidance to startups but also offering real-time insights into the mindset
    of
    investors. Moreover, I saw an opportunity to catalyze a mindset shift among seasoned investors, igniting their
    enthusiasm for the rising biotech sector in India.</p>
<p>You see, when you talk to investors from the US or Europe, their perception of Indian biotech startups may not always
    be
    favorable. They may question the quality and quantity of innovation emerging from India. But therein lies the
    challenge
    and the joy—I am driven to handpick the top 1% of startups working on cutting-edge deep tech solutions and showcase
    their potential to the world. I want to be a trusted ally for these startup founders, offering guidance not only in
    technical matters but also in navigating the complexities of securing private investment in the biotech space.</p>
<p>In essence, my motivation to join the world of venture capital stems from a desire to empower startup founders, to be
    a
    beacon of support and mentorship as they navigate the tumultuous waters of entrepreneurship. I am driven by the
    prospect
    of showcasing India's capabilities in the biotech domain and reshaping the narrative surrounding Indian innovation
    on a
    global scale. This is what excites me about the journey ahead in venture capital.</p>
<p>During my travels, I traversed nearly all the Indian states and union territories, with the exception of Bihar. My
    aim
    was to ensure that people across India were aware of the impactful work being carried out at IIT Kanpur, beyond the
    conventional engineering achievements commonly associated with institutions like IIT Bombay or IIT Delhi.</p>
<p>Thanks to the concerted efforts led by individuals like Professor Amitabha, we were able to restore some of the
    recognition and relevance of IIT Kanpur, especially during the challenging times of the Covid-19 pandemic. Our
    collaborative initiatives, such as the ventilator project and oxygen support, showcased the institution's commitment
    to
    making a meaningful impact on society and revitalized its reputation.</p>

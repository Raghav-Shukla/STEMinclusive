<p><a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/new/sasmita-patnaik" target="_blank">Dr. Sasmita Patnaik</a> is an Associate
    professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at IIT Kanpur. Her research interest broadly is in
    operator theory including commutators of compact operators, solvability of certain
    bilinear operator equations, and Lie algebras of compact operators. What
    follows next is her inspiring story in her own words.
<h2 class="section-heading">A brief about your childhood, your journey in pursuing mathematics, and challenges along the
    way</h2>
<p>I was born in Ranchi, Jharkhand in the year 1980. My schooling until 10th was in Kairali School, a CBSE public school
    established in 1978 and run by the Malayalee Association, Ranchi. In a way, we (the school and myself) grew
    together. I
    then joined Delhi Public School, Ranchi and completed by 12th in 1998.</p>
<p>While majority of my classmates were scratching their heads day and night to crack the engineering and medical exams,
    I
    was weaving an unconventional dream in my mind to pursue a degree that would keep me out of this crowd. So, I
    decided to
    join a four-year integrated B.Sc.-B.Ed. program in the Regional Institute of Education, Bhubaneswar. During the last
    year of this program, we had to go for a 3-month teaching internship to a school. This was my first stepping stone
    into
    academics in a way and the starting point of my dream to become real. Throughout my schooling and undergraduate
    studies,
    I have had a special affinity towards blackboard and chalk. I would run to the blackboard to solve math problems.
    Talking about mathematics, I am deeply inspired by my mother, who has a love for mathematics ever since her
    childhood
    days. She would spend hours at night explaining me trigonometry and arithmetic. Her energy and enthusiasm had no
    bounds
    and this sparked a powerful impact on my interest to pursue mathematics.</p>
<p>After completing my M.Sc. in mathematics from Utkal University, Bhubaneswar in 2004, I took a year off to prepare
    entrance exams for Ph.D. program in Indian research institutions. I joined one of those research institutes, but
    soon I
    faced difficulties with its curriculum and the atmosphere was quite discouraging for me. I was then advised by one
    of
    the mathematics professors to apply abroad for the Ph.D. program. That was a big shift for me. In my world, nothing
    outside India existed for real. Setting up my mind to go abroad, and even before that, preparing GRE, TOEFL, etc.
    was a
    lot on my plate. Nevertheless, I was adamant at not giving up. I am a person who takes one day at a time. So, I
    started
    my preparation and in my third attempt, I could finally get through these exams. It took me almost a year to get all
    this done and during this period, I was completely oblivious to my surroundings. The only thing I kept telling to
    myself
    is that I shall overcome whatever it takes to do mathematics. I received offers from University of Cincinnati, USA
    and
    University of Nottingham, UK. I decided to join University of Cincinnati and moved in 2007. Looking back, I always
    express my gratitude to that difficult phase of my life when I had faced failures. And I believe that it was the
    best
    thing that had happened to me because it helped me to push my limits and harness my potentials and strengths. I took
    these shortcomings as the means to bring out the better of myself.</p>
<p>My six years of stay in the US was indeed a blessing for me. The academic atmosphere provided just the right
    environment
    for me to grow. In particular, the attitude of “growing together” rather than “competing against each other” was the
    big
    difference as compared to institutes in India. I completed my Ph.D. in December 2012. I taught there for a semester
    as
    an Adjunct instructor and then moved back to India.</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">What advice would you give high school students considering Mathematics?</h2>
<p>As the question specifically aims at mathematics, I prefer to answer it in a way that will just do the job in a
    nutshell. I will quote an excerpt from the book “How Not To Be Wrong” written by Jordan Ellenberg, who gave a
    beautiful
    realistic explanation to ‘Why do Mathematics?’</p>
<p>“Mathematics is not just a sequence of computations to be carried out by rote until your patience or stamina runs
    out—although it might seem that way from what you have been taught in courses called mathematics. Those integrals
    are to
    mathematics as weight training and calisthenics are to soccer. If you want to play soccer—I mean, really play, at a
    competitive level—you have got to do a lot of boring, repetitive, apparently pointless drills. Do professional
    players
    ever use those drills? Well, you won’t see anybody on the filed curling a weight or zigzagging between traffic
    cones.
    But you do see players using the strength, speed, insight, and flexibility they built up doing those drills, week
    after
    tedious week. Learning those drills is part of learning soccer.”</p>
<p>“Mathematics is pretty much the same. You may not be aiming for a mathematically oriented career. That’s fine—most
    people aren’t. But you can still do math. You probably already are doing math, even if you don’t call it math. Math
    is
    woven into the way we reason. And math makes you better at things. Knowing mathematics is like wearing a pair of
    X-ray
    specs that reveal hidden structures underneath the messy and chaotic surface of the world. Math is a science of not
    being wrong about things, its techniques and habits hammered out by centuries of hard work and argument. With the
    tools
    of mathematics in hand, you can understand the world in a deeper, sounder, and more meaningful way.”
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">How do you see the field of Mathematics evolving in the future, and what role can students
    play in shaping that
    evolution?</h2>
<p>Over the years, MATH to me stands for Morality, Accountability, Truth, Humanity. It touches upon every aspect of
    human
    life. I envision mathematics as an inevitable tool that bridges the gap between seemingly different areas of work.
    Students play a pivotal role in bringing up this connection. Early on, students should be trained to develop clarity
    of
    thought in decision making, maintain transparency in the system, and more importantly, curious to know why certain
    things happen in a certain way. Mathematics is indeed the tool to acquire these virtues. It trains you to build
    courage,
    freedom, and justice, which are some of the basic human desires. It takes time and effort on both the teachers and
    the
    students; but in the long run, it’s worth it.</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">Notes of Gratitude to people who helped you along the way.</h2>
<p>First of all, I am grateful to my parents, who have been by my side all through my journey so far. Their blessings
    and
    the innumerable occasions when they took my stand shaped my life. Especially my mother, a strong lady who went
    against
    all odds to help me pursue my interests and believed in me more than I do myself.</p>
<p>During my Master’s program, I got an opportunity to participate in the Mathematics Training and Talent Search program
    (famously known as MTTS program). That was an eye-opening event for me, as I got a chance to be around some of the
    great
    teachers in mathematics. I was in awe to see the way they gave us the training. For instance, one of the math
    teachers
    told us not to write anything on our notebook until he asked us to. He explained the mathematical ideas verbally
    without
    writing anything on the blackboard, and then after he was done, we were asked to write it down in our own words
    based on
    our understanding. Just being around them further charged me up to pursue higher studies in mathematics.</p>
<p>Until I went to the US, there was something that seemed lacking in my mathematical journey, the importance of writing
    mathematics. During my first year of course work in the US, I was fortunate to take two courses under Professor
    Nageswari Shunmugalingam. She spent enormous amount of time and energy in helping us to be sensitive about writing
    mathematics. Well, to the extent that she would deduct points, even for making a slight slip in our writing. So, I
    am
    thankful to her for teaching me the essence of it.</p>
<p>My Ph.D. advisor, Professor Gary Weiss, was a lively and an energetic person, who influenced my mathematical life in
    an
    enormous way. I was his first Ph.D. student. His work style was quite unusual. For instance, we rarely had meetings
    in
    his office. He was a foodie, so we often had our meetings in restaurants and sometimes in parks. My favourite were
    the
    Vietnamese and the Thai restaurants. One of the important things that he made clear to me early on was that there
    shouldn’t be any student-teacher role in our conversations; it should be a discussion just between two
    mathematicians.
    At times, I would just listen to him, he would then stop and say, “Come on, fight back!” Going above all kinds of
    disparities and experiencing freedom while working with him gave a new dimension to my mathematical perspective.
    Later,
    we continued to be wonderful collaborators for over a decade.</p>
<p>I would like to make my concluding remarks addressing the high school students because they are the beginners of the
    future: each one of you is a gem in your own way. Never lose that individuality and help each other grow together
    for a
    better community, as you will also be a part of it. Make friendship with mathematics in any form, it will soon
    become
    your life-coach.</p>

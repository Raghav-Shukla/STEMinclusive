<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/usha-udaar-b2317025/?originalSubdomain=in" target="_blank">Dr. Usha Udaar</a> is
    a professor of linguistics and Language research at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. Her
    research interests include general linguistics, linguistic variation and the generative theory of Language, and she
    has
    a lot to her journey in this relatively new field of research.</p>
<p>Dr. Udaar was brought up in Delhi and had a really eventful childhood, while being exposed to several languages such
    as
    Hindi, English, Haryanvi (her mother tongue), and Punjabi. A good student in school, she had planned earlier on to
    get
    into the tech side of roles and fields.</p>
<p>During her undergraduate programme in elementary education from the University of Delhi, two courses on linguistics
    made
    her enthusiastic about the same, and to pursue her desire of being a good advocate for English and teaching the
    language, while also research about underrepresented Indian languages, she finished her Masters from Jawaharlal
    Nehru
    University.</p>
<p>She completed her PhD. in the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, under the supervision of Prof. Pritha Chandra.
    She
    is a fanatic of the system in IITs, and loves being around these technical institutes rather than other
    universities.</p>
<p>Dr. Udaar is critical of the current method of language instruction at the school level, pointing out how grammar is
    often limited to a set of rules without delving into the scientific and cognitive aspects behind why a language is
    spoken a certain way. She believes that since literature is a well-established field in language, when one wishes to
    pursue a career in language, it is presumed that they mean the literary aspect. She draws analogy from art. She says
    that while paintings can be the artistic perspective, and architecture the more technical and scientific, they are
    both
    composed of the same building blocks.</p>
<p>She points out that linguistics is a relatively new area of research (originating in the 1950s), hence the stereotype
    about pursuing literature while mentioning a career in linguistics may prevail.</p>
<p>When asked about any challenges she faced as a girl pursuing a scientific education, she thanks her parents for not
    discriminating between her and her brother in the field of education. She remembers that her parents not only gave
    her
    the freedom to pursue the field of her choice, but also to not worry about the future, irrespective of academic or
    financial success. She retrospects that her parents may have been the ones to face the backlash from a society which
    runs with stereotypes, and she thanks them for not letting her feel any of it, and giving her the freedom to pursue
    an
    area of research that had just begun to grow.</p>
<p>To future linguists, Dr. Udaar says that linguistics may not be a fruitful career yet, but it is a new branch with a
    lot
    of scope, especially since the Noam Chomsky revolution in the 1950s-70s. She believes it is a wonderful and unique
    scientific field with a lot of potential, especially with information across the world flooding the Internet. She is
    confident that now is the time linguistics would see its boom.</p>
<p>To the girls out there who wish to pursue an unorthodox career, she advises to be headstrong. "Never shy away from
    what
    you want; but once you know what to do, give all you have in it. With being headstrong, comes an internal pressure
    to
    live up to what you aimed for. Give your best."</p>
<p>She also notices that girls have an advantage in a typical Indian patriarchal society not to have a societal
    expectation
    to earn for the family, and thus they are not always pressured to take education seriously. She advises girls to use
    this opportunity to perform to their best and explore their potential, without worrying about any expectations.</p>
<p>To future students of language, she advises to never forget their root language, since she believes in the inherent
    linguistic variations that occur across dialects as well as languages that can be dived into as a study in
    linguistics.
    She also encourages them to ask questions, without fear or hesitation.</p>
<p>She is grateful Dr. Pritha Chandra for not only supervising her PhD, but also for being her inspiration in the field
    of
    linguistics. She thanks Mrs. Sudha Dutta, her English teacher in school, for polishing her understanding of the
    language
    and being firm about making her appreciate English.</p>
<p>She expresses her gratitude to her parents; her father for giving her freedom, not discriminating against her for
    being
    a girl, not putting on her the pressure of earning for the family; her mother with an analogy to the mother eagle,
    who
    removes the soft grass from the nest so that the chicks, once grown up, could experience the hard pebbles beneath.

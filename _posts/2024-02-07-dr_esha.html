        Chatterjee</a> is a professor in the department of humanities and social sciences at IIT Kanpur. Her
    specialization lies in the fields of demography, gender, work and family.</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">A brief about your childhood</h2>
<p>I was born and brought up in Kolkata, West Bengal. I finished my schooling from Kendriya Vidyala. Both of my parents
    were professors at IIM Calcutta. My father’s specialization was operations management and my mother’s specialization
    was
    organizational behavior. I always enjoyed math as well as science and took up the science stream in my senior
    secondary
    classes. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What inspired you to pursue Sociology</h2>
<p>I was not particularly inclined towards engineering or medicine, but wanted to pursue a field that had a significant
    mathematical component. I explored Economics on my parents' suggestion. I looked up texts and developed an interest
    in
    the subject. I enrolled in Calcutta University where I pursued my bachelor’s in science in Economics. In my
    undergraduate studies, development economics interested me the most. I pursued my M.A. and M.Phil in economics at
    Jadavpur University. There, I used to actively participate in behavioral economics labs, and enjoyed doing class
    projects. During my M.Phil, I stumbled across a research article in health economics. This sparked my interest in
    that
    domain. I then decided to pursue a doctorate in the fields of development economics, and health economics.</p>
<p>I was very clear that I wanted to work on health inequalities in India. During my school days, witnessing gender
    inequalities, particularly in terms of education and health, ignited a passion within me to address these societal
    issues. I was driven by a desire to understand the reasons behind these disparities and work towards finding
    solutions.
    Even in my statement of purpose for applying to graduate schools abroad, I highlighted my dedication to addressing
    health and education-related inequalities in India. While applying to different departments for further studies,
    including in the areas of policy and economics, I ultimately found my path in sociology at the University of
    Maryland.
    There, I pursued my Masters and Phd in sociology on full scholarship.
</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">What are you currently working on?</h2>
<p>My research interests are in the fields of sociology of health, ageing, migration, family and demography of the labor
    force. One of the research projects that I worked on during my PhD that gained media coverage too, was addressing
    the
    issue of low women’s labor force participation in India. In India, unlike developed countries, there is a peculiar
    trend
    where an increase in education doesn’t necessarily lead to an increase in labor force participation for women.
    Factors
    like job preferences, societal norms, the scarcity of acceptable job opportunities and high levels of gender
    segregation
    in white-collar jobs contribute to this phenomenon. I am currently working on a city level survey to understand the
    needs of older adults and enable building age-friendly cities with a focus on three key aspects namely: i) community
    and
    social infrastructure; ii) technological engagement; and iii) healthcare and wellbeing.

<h2 class="section-heading"> Any challenges you faced along the way and how did you overcome them?</h2>
<p>I express gratitude to my family's unwavering support. My parents encouraged me during moments of academic struggle.
    One
    significant challenge I encountered was the unexpected performance in my mathematics board exam during my school
    days.
    Despite excelling in the subject throughout my academic journey, a misreading of a question which led to a waste of
    time
    contributing to a poor performance in the exam. My father's support and encouragement were pivotal during this time.
    He
    not only reassured me but shared his own stories of overcoming challenges. This experience taught me not to perceive
    failure as a definitive outcome, and highlighted the importance of having a strong support system.</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">What advice would you give high school students?</h2>
<p>In my life journey, I've gathered some valuable lessons that I want to share with students. Firstly, I urge you not
    to
    overly invest your emotions in one aspect of life. Balance is the key. Embrace persistence and passion, but don't be
    too
    hard on yourself. Life is a journey, and setbacks are a part of it.</p>
<p>Follow your interests passionately and maintain discipline along the way. However, it's crucial to understand that
    it's
    okay to take breaks and focus on self-love. Striking a balance between being disciplined and knowing when to take
    time
    off contributes to long-term success. Remember, success is a marathon, not a sprint.
</p>
<p>
    Let setbacks be lessons, not definitions of your life. Embrace the broader perspective that in the long run most
    people
    will succeed, regardless of occasional setbacks and failures. Appreciate the ebb and flow of life, and don't let
    temporary challenges overshadow your long-term vision. Life is a series of chapters, and each setback is just a
    turning
    point towards a new beginning.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Note of gratitude</h2>
<p>Expressing gratitude is essential, and I extend my thanks to my parents, grandmother, partner, my supervisor,
    teachers,
    mentors, and friends who provided unconditional support throughout my journey. Each person, at different stages of
    my
    life, played a significant role in shaping my experiences. Their presence, encouragement, and understanding have
    been
    invaluable, contributing to my personal and academic growth.

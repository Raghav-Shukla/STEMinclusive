Prof. Esha Chatterjee is a professor in the department of humanities and social sciences at IIT Kanpur. Her specialization lies in the fields of demography, gender, work and family.
A brief about your childhood.
I was born and brought up in Kolkata, West Bengal. I finished my schooling from Kendriya Vidyala. Both of my parents were professors at IIM Calcutta. My father’s specialization was operations research and my mother’s specialization was organizational research. I always enjoyed math as well as science and took up the science stream in my senior secondary classes.
What inspired you to pursue your field, and what was your journey?
I was not particularly inclined towards engineering or medicine, but wanted to pursue a field that had a significant mathematical component. I explored Economics on my parents' suggestion. I looked up texts and developed interest in the subject. I enrolled in Calcutta University where I pursued my bachelor’s in science in Economics. In my undergraduate studies, development economics interested me the most. I pursued my M.Phil in Jadavpur University. There, I used to actively participate in labs, class projects and games. During my M.Phil, I stumbled across a research article in health economics. This sparked my interest in that domain. I had then decided to pursue a doctorate in the fields of development economics, health economics and experimental economics.
I was very clear that I wanted to work on health inequalities in india. During my school days, witnessing gender inequalities, particularly in terms of education and health, ignited a passion within me to address these societal issues. I was driven by a desire to understand the reasons behind these disparities and work towards finding solutions. Even in my statement of purpose for applying to graduate schools abroad, I highlighted my dedication to addressing health and education-related inequalities in India. While applying to different departments for further studies, including policy and economics, I ultimately found my path in sociology in University of Maryland. There, I pursued my Masters and Phd on full scholarship.
What are you currently working on?
My research focuses on the relationship between women's education and labor force participation. In India, unlike developed countries, there is a peculiar trend where the correlation between education and labor force participation takes a J or U-shaped curve. Factors like job preferences, societal norms, and the scarcity of acceptable job opportunities contribute to this phenomenon. My research aims to understand why education doesn't seamlessly translate into increased labor force participation for women.
Any challenges you faced along the way and how did you overcome them?
I express gratitude to my family's unwavering support. My parents encouraged me during moments of academic struggle. One significant challenge I encountered was the unexpected performance in my mathematics board exam during my school days. Despite excelling in the subject throughout my academic journey, a misunderstanding of a question led to a poor performance. My father's support and encouragement were pivotal during this time. He not only reassured me but shared his own stories of overcoming challenges. This experience taught me not to perceive failure as a definitive outcome and the importance of a strong support system.




What advice would you give high school students?
In my life journey, I've gathered some valuable lessons that I want to share with students. Firstly, I urge you not to overly invest your emotions in one aspect of life. Balance is key. Embrace persistence and passion, but don't be too hard on yourself. Life is a journey, and setbacks are a part of it.
Follow your interests passionately and maintain discipline along the way. However, it's crucial to understand that it's okay to take breaks and focus on self-love. Striking a balance between being disciplined and knowing when to take time off contributes to long-term success. Remember, success is a marathon, not a sprint.
Let setbacks be lessons, not definitions of your life. Embrace the broader perspective that most people are doing well. Appreciate the ebb and flow of life, and don't let temporary challenges overshadow your long-term vision. Life is a series of chapters, and each setback is just a turning point towards a new beginning.
Notes of Gratitude to people who helped you along the way
Expressing gratitude is essential, and I extend my thanks to my parents, grandmother, partner, and friends who provided unconditional support throughout my journey. Each person, at different stages of my life, played a significant role in shaping my experiences. Their presence, encouragement, and understanding have been invaluable, contributing to my personal and academic growth.

            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>STEMinclusive IIT Kanpur was founded by Shubhan Ravi, a senior undergraduate from IIT Kanpur. He is the
                Core Team Mentor of Mumbai-based <a href="https://steminclusive.in/" target="_blank">STEMinclusive</a>
                and founded its first chapter at IIT Kanpur. We believe in the power
                of representation, storytelling, and community to inspire the next generation of women in India to
                pursue
                their dreams in STEM fields.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Our mission is simple yet profound: to shatter stereotypes, break down barriers, and pave the way for
                women to thrive in STEM. We are committed to creating a world where every young girl in India knows that
                her potential is limitless.</p>

            <h2>How we make a difference</h2>
            <p>In India, as in many parts of the world, women have been historically underrepresented in STEM. We
                believe that this gender gap not only deprives our society of diverse perspectives and innovation but
                also limits the potential of countless talented individuals. STEMinclusive IIT Kanpur aims to change
                this by:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Spotlighting Remarkable Women:</strong> We showcase the stories of extraordinary women from
                    IIT Kanpur who
                    have excelled in various STEM fields. By
                    featuring accomplished women in STEM, we provide role models for young girls to look up to,
                    demonstrating that they too can excel in these fields.
                <li>
                    <strong>Building a Supportive Community:</strong> We
                    encourage networking, mentorship, and collaboration among women in STEM and those aspiring to join
                    the field.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Encouraging STEM Education:</strong> We actively conduct STEMinclusive RISE sessions at
                    local schools to ensure that every girl with an interest in STEM has the resources and
                    opportunities to succeed.
